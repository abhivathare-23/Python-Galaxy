#tuple items are ordered, unchangable and allow duplicate values 
#tuple items are indexed - the first item has index [0]

# ordered - tuples are ordered, it means items have a defined order, and that order will not change
# unchangable - means we cannot change, add or remove items after tuple has been created
# allow duplicates - tuples are indexed, they can have items with same value

#To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, 
# otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
